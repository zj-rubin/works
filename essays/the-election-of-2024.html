                    "Deterrence is a very peculiar form of action: it is what causes
                    something to not take place. It dominates the whole of our contemporary
                    period, which tends not so much to produce events as to cause something
                    not to occur, while looking as though it is a historical event. Or else
                    events do not take place in the stead of some other event which did not.
                    War, history, reality and passion -- deterrence plays its part in all of
                    these. It causes strange events to take place(!), events which do not in
                    any way advance history, but rather run it backwards, back along the
                    opposite slope, unintelligible to our historical sense (only things
                    which move in the direction of history have historical meaning, events
                    which no longer have a negative (progressive, critical or revolutionary)
                    potency since their only negativity is in the fact of their not taking
                    place. Disturbing."

                <p>In just a few hours, we will see the results of one of the most
                momentous elections in American history. In just a few hours, the result
                that we will see will create the future of American politics for perhaps
                decades to come‚Äîor will it? One of the most defining characteristics
                of this presidential race has been the centrality of the fear of
                calamity. In a way, electoral messaging has accelerated to a breaking
                point. In the final exit poll, democratic voters listed the "state of
                democracy" as their top voting issue, at a whopping 58% of the poll.
                Combined with apocalyptic (though certainly not unfounded) messaging
                around climate change, the (also not unfounded) threat of the heritage
                foundation's project 2025 gutting the administrative state in order to
                facilitate a more authoritarian executive branch, and many other aspects
                of a potential second Trump administration such as unstable foreign
                policy, the slate of major voting issues has turned this election for
                democratic voters from choosing whatever option is in the best interest
                of the voter to saving America and potentially the entire world itself.
                This is absolutely mirrored on the republican side, as many voters are
                concerned with the endemic corrupting force of "wokeness", a potent
                energy which seeps Marxism into our institutions, incompetence into our
                government, brainwashing into our schools, and transgenderism into our
                children‚Äîthe very work of the devil himself to overturn the good heart
                of America. Along with the threat of illegal immigrants coming into our
                beautiful nation and bringing drugs and crime onto our pure soil, slowly
                infiltrating neighborhoods until our noble American culture is swept
                away by foreign people that don't share our values, this election is
                certainly a battle for the future. For the conservative, this is a war
                for the soul of our country being fought between good and evil‚ÄîTrump,
                the outsider who represents the humble yet noble American spirit, taking
                on the nefarious forces of the deep state and political elite. It is
                almost exhausting how cinematic this election is. Indeed, the textbooks
                are already being written. This is absolutely momentous‚Äîthe question
                of which road our country will either go down the path of equality,
                civil rights, and peace (or perhaps we could say wokeness, rioting, and
                degeneracy) or traditional values, safety, and freedom (or perhaps we
                could say authoritarianism, political violence, and prejudice). Things
                have accelerated to the breaking point. Electoral messaging has achieved
                its most effective form. The election is no longer what happens in the
                ballot box, it is entirely the political ads we see on TV. Politics has
                entirely become the question of narrative. As a Pennsylvania resident,
                it seems that almost every single ad I have seen for the past couple
                weeks has been political. It is clear from this bombardment of images
                upon images that what these parties are advertising are images for the
                future. Politics is no longer the obligation of the intelligent man to
                exercise his constitutional right to determine who is most fit to lead
                the grand ol' nation of the US of A, but it is now an existential battle
                for the future according to whichever understanding of what issues are
                facing us that you subscribe to. A society of the spectacle has created
                a government of the spectacle. The cultural industries and forces which
                have permeated every single aspect of consumer society have too
                penetrated the process of federal elections. That's the most effective
                method. Celebrity endorsements and going on talk shows were not the
                limit in forging a massive, immersive social-political project. Engaging
                with culture is helpful, but becoming culture is entirely more
                effective. It is a shame that Jean Baudrillard died nine years before
                Trump's election in 2016, as it was perhaps one of the biggest
                affirmations of his theories. The cultural is entirely dominating‚Äîso
                much so that consumerism has become entirely dependent on the "cultural
                industries", creating an economy structured around the sign value and no
                longer the use value of a commodity. The spectacle has entrenched new
                mechanisms of power and production. After all, our president was a
                reality TV host. To reiterate‚Äîthe former president was a reality TV
                host and media star. For emphasis: THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
                STATES OF AMERICA WAS A REALITY TELEVISION HOST, MEDIA PERSONALITY, AND
                OWNER OF A MASSIVE MEDIA EMPIRE. Truly, it is a shame that Baudrillard
                died before ever being able to witness such an event. Being a good
                president is easy, but getting people to vote for you is difficult.
                Trump understood this, that is why he dedicated much of his time while
                still being the sitting president to continuing to campaign across the
                United States, also making sure that his actions constantly fed into a
                spectacle‚Äîfeeding a constant news cycle centered around himself. This
                is perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of this current
                presidential race: what exactly comprises the messaging of these
                campaigns? For Trump's campaign, it is a fight against the woke left,
                the deep state (an evil force supported by and comprised of billionaire
                liberal elites), and internal forces which seek to tear the country and
                its traditional values apart. To the conservative, America is under
                threat by radical ideas that seek to overturn every positive aspect of
                the country and screw over the average, red-blooded American in order to
                facilitate some left-wing, woke ideological dystopia. The messaging of
                the republican campaign is not centered around a clear vision of the
                future, but saving the country from an internal, existential threat. For
                Kamala Harris's campaign, the messaging is heavily centered around the
                potential horrors that a second trump administration may bring,
                including a national abortion ban, a more authoritarian government, and
                the litany of insane proposals outlined in the project 2025 document. It
                is for this reason that one of Kamala Harris's most used chants is
                "we're not going back". Trump understood the power of maintaining a
                spectacle around his campaign, but while it was effective at keeping his
                supporters constantly engaged, it had the same effect for his opponents.
                This is why Harris is able to run on the negativity of that
                spectacle‚Äîwhile Trump made liking him an effective political platform,
                he also made disliking him an effective political platform as well. When
                we consider Trump and Harris's 2024 political platforms, we are faced
                with an interesting finding: Trump's messaging focuses primarily on the
                internal threat that the ideals of the left pose to the futurity of the
                United States, and Harris's messaging focuses primarily on the internal
                threat that the ideals of the right pose to the futurity of the United
                States. Opposition has no longer become the byproduct of engagement, but
                the core of political messaging itself. It has always been effective
                political messaging for a candidate to say that they should be elected
                president and the voter should hate their opponent, but it is now that
                the candidate can say that they should be elected president because of
                the hatred the voter should have for their opponent. This is the utter
                perfection of political messaging itself. The society of the spectacle
                has created a politics of pure spectacle. The primary goal of a campaign
                is to manufacture an existential threat‚Äîa pure spectacle of fear,
                while simultaneously creating the candidate as a spectacle of greatness
                and salvation. This explains the utter illusiveness of the Trump
                campaign's policies and the dominance of the grievance in voter
                determination. Much of the spectacle essential to republican messaging
                incurs the focus of grievances not necessarily connected to messaging or
                policy positions held by the democratic campaign. Not only has political
                messaging become disconnected from the actual policy proposals of the
                candidates, but those political messages are themselves no longer
                representative of the source from which they were derived. The ritual of
                political combat inherent to the election has consumed the entirety of
                the event, but that itself has become meaningless as the totality of the
                message consumes all of the available space possible in order to
                maximize the spectacle. When I say that the election of 2024 will not
                take place, it is not that I believe the mechanisms of government will
                not function properly to ensure that votes are counted correctly and the
                proper candidate will become inaugurated as the new president, but
                rather that the entire event that we are calling "the election of 2024"
                is not the same kind of event that brought James Madison, Abraham
                Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt to the White House‚Äîfor this event is
                instead a hyperreal phenomenon marked by simulacra, a giant reality
                television show masquerading as an election.</p>

                <p>At the time at which I am finally finishing this essay, 26 out of the
                538 electoral votes have been counted. While we can observe the
                totalizing force of the spectacle, it is still worth noting that I
                absolutely still believe in the value of political engagement. I do
                believe that the ideas espoused by Trump and Vance are reprehensible and
                hateful, and that it is still absolutely true that a Trump victory will
                have disastrous effects on the political, economic, and social futures
                of this country. On a personal level, no matter what happens, I just
                want the anxiety of this infuriatingly close election‚Äîthat was
                absolutely impossible to reasonably predict the result of‚Äîto
                dissipate. American politics is horrific. Disturbing.</p>
